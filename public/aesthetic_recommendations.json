  "description": "For optimal skin rejuvenation, we recommend starting with a deep cleansing facial to eliminate impurities and revitalize dull skin. This can be followed by a customized enzyme or chemical peel to gently exfoliate and promote cellular renewal. Incorporating oxygen therapy will help boost circulation and restore a healthy glow. For acne-prone skin, LED light therapy—especially blue light—is effective in reducing inflammation and targeting acne-causing bacteria. Finally, a soothing hydration mask and professional sun defense finish ensure your skin is protected and deeply nourished.",
